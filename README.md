## 🧩 Overview
Couchy VocalFX is a modular real-time audio processor.  
It allows you to **create, compile, and run voice effects** using `.vocaleffect` scripts written in Python.  
You can monitor your microphone directly or process it through any custom effect in real time.

## 📦 Installation
1. Download the two .Exe files from the Releases page.
2. Launch the `VocalFX_Editor.exe` and create your custom effect and export it.
3. Launch the `VocalFX_Runner.exe` and select your Microphone and your output Microphone (If you don't have a custom one download something like SteelseriesGG and use their Sonar feature OR get VB-AudioCable and do it that way)
4. Select your Effect and change the Gain to your liking and press Start Processing

## 📦 Extra Notes About Usage:
You will have to press Stop and then press Start Processing again to change to a different effect. I might make an upgraded version later down the line that fixes this so you don't have to.
